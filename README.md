# Maze

The goal of this project is to write a program that will automatically generate and solve mazes. Each time run the program, it will generate and print a new random maze and the solution. Then use depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) to find path from the entry to the end. Then use DFS to find the shortest path.
